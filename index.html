        <h1>LemonStand pre-order module</h1>

        <h2>Why?</h2>

          <p>There are very few things in the LemonStand system by default to help you show interface hints to customers for items that are on pre-order.
            This is a pretty basic task. Since you don't want to have to go through the product description with every pre-order you run and then find and remove
            the pre-order information. What could be simpler than a checkbox? </p>

            <p>Yes, there is a built in "pre-order" function under the Inventory tab. However,
            this button also makes it so customers can buy an unlimited number of product without question. This can be very alarming if you pre-sell items that
            are in high demand but low availability. So, this simple module helps you to easily state whether an item is on pre-order, what its release date is, and
            give any extra information needed. Then, when the product releases, it is as easy as a checkbox to remove all the information from the frontend and
            sales continue as normal.
          </p>

<h2>How?</h2>

<h3>Install instructions</h3>

<p>Installation is very simple. You can either get the module as you would any other on the <a href="http://lemonstand.com/marketplace/module/garbeepreorder/">Marketplace</a> or you can download the code directly via GitHub.</p>
<blockquote>It is recommended to get the module via the marketplace. It is much simpler to install and update in case any updates are required.</blockquote>
  <h4>Marketplace</h4>
    <p>If you decide to download via the marketplace. Simply add the module to your account and then bind it to your license like you would any other module. Then upon updating your copy of LemonStand you will recieve the module.
  <h4>Manual install</h4>
    <p>So, you want to do this the hard way? Fortunately, it is still pretty easy.
      <ol>
        <li>Manually download the source from Github. A ZIP file is available here{needs to be link}.
        <li>From there unzip the files locally using your favorite program.
        <li>Once the files are unzipped, open an SFTP (or any other secure line) connection to your website install.
        <li>Go to the "modules" folder from the document root of the LemonStand install.
        <li>Make a new folder called "garbeepreorder".
        <li>Upload the files there and login to your backend.
      </ol>
