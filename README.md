ls-module-preorder

This is a module for the [LemonStand ecommerce software](http://lemonstand.com). It adds a pre-order tab to the product interface. Within this tab are three fields:
1. A checkbox for saying of a product is on pre-order or not.
2. A release date field. This is displayed as a date input.
3. An extra details input. This is an HTML input field which is rendered as a TinyMCE (WYSIWYG) instance.
